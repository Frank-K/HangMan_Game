# HangMan_Game

This program allows the user to play a game of hangman.

It uses graphics.py and button.py both created by John Zelle. 
I made a slight change to the original button.py allowing the colour of the button to be changed

The images needed to play this game can be found under the 'issues' section of the repository.
They can also be downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r0g4m71jvi1i98q/AADHD6EKpfFlhJgk0va0ppH1a?dl=0
